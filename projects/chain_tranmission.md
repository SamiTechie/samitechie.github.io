A transmission chain in telecommunications refers to the series of processes through which data travels from source to destination. It involves the conversion of data into a suitable format for transmission (encoding), modification for effective transport (modulation), and passage through a specific medium (like wire, radio waves, etc.). These signals are then demodulated and decoded at the receiver end for use.
