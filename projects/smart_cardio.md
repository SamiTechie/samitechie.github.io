summary: "Addressing global cardiovascular diseases, we've built a device that extracts ECG signals and employs deep learning for vital health diagnoses."
---

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally. In response to this, we have developed a device connected to software that extracts ECG signals using sensors. This information is then diagnosed using deep learning techniques, providing an advanced approach to potentially lifesaving health insights.

The subsequent visuals display various aspects of the application in operation.
