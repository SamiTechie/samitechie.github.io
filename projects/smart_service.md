This project is an innovative application of facial recognition technology designed to provide secure and efficient access to various educational services, including attestation of attendance, proof of success, and profile viewing. It was developed in response to the persistent challenges students face, such as the time-consuming queues and bureaucratic hurdles often encountered when trying to secure necessary academic documents. It also features a password-based fallback access method in case facial recognition fails. This project aims to provide a user-friendly solution that not only enhances the academic experience for students but also effectively reduces the long waiting times typically associated with accessing academic services.

Our project is presented in the following images.

<pre>
You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
